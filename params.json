{"name":"Fightingness","tagline":"RPG Game site for Michael Epstein","body":"# fightingness\r\n============\r\n\r\n## RPG game developed for Michael Epstein\r\n\r\nA responsive homepage I did for a friend, he asked me to do him a favor so I was going to do a whole Wordpress custom theme for him but at the last minute I was told there was no money. I still did the homepage for him, but do to time constraints and my new job I could only bat out a responsive home page.\r\n\r\nI used Twitter's Bootstap to up and running fast and did my own custom media queries for the custom view-ports. This was the first project I did using Bootstrap, I normally use Zurb's Foundation 3 or 4 for this sort of thing. It just took me a minute or two to go over how they call the classes and bam, instant site.\r\n\r\nGotta love these times, never been a better time to be doing front-end development. There are so many tools at your disposal, it's insane! I love it :)\r\nI hope to finish the site for these guys soon, but unfortunately I need to make a living and can't do free work anymore. I wish these guys the best of luck and if you're into RPG's then checkout their site. I'm not sure what the URL is going to be since I may or may not be the one one that will be finishing this.(If they can wait and scrape up a few bucks, I could see myself sacrificing some family time to finish this for them) Just Google ` Fightingness`, that's the name of their game.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look at some of my work.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
