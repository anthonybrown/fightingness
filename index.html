<h2>RPG game developed for Michael Epstein</h2>

<p>A responsive homepage I did for a friend, he asked me to do him a favor so I was going to do a whole Wordpress custom theme for him but at the last minute I was told there was no money. I still did the homepage for him, but do to time constraints and my new job I could only bat out a responsive home page.</p>

<p>I used Twitter's Bootstap to up and running fast and did my own custom media queries for the custom view-ports. This was the first project I did using Bootstrap, I normally use Zurb's Foundation 3 or 4 for this sort of thing. It just took me a minute or two to go over how they call the classes and bam, instant site.</p>

<p>Gotta love these times, never been a better time to be doing front-end development. There are so many tools at your disposal, it's insane! I love it :)
I hope to finish the site for these guys soon, but unfortunately I need to make a living and can't do free work anymore. I wish these guys the best of luck and if you're into RPG's then checkout their site. I'm not sure what the URL is going to be since I may or may not be the one one that will be finishing this.(If they can wait and scrape up a few bucks, I could see myself sacrificing some family time to finish this for them) Just Google <code>Fightingness</code>, that's the name of their game.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking a look at some of my work.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
