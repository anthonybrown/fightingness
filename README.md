fightingness
============

RPG game developed for Michael Epstein

Changed the PSD so the layout would work for responsive site. Using Bootstrap
instead of Foundation this time, need to get up to speed with Boostrap because
it's the most popular CSS/JS framework despite how I feel about it not being as
good (for me) as Zurb's Foundation 3 + 4 :)
