fightingness
============

RPG game developed for Michael Epstein

Made a responsive homepage for the game `Fightingness`. Used Twitter's
bootstrap responsive css. It was actually a joy to use and I will be probably
using it along with Zurb's Foundation 3 + 4

If the guys can wait, I will make a custom Wordpress theme for the site, as it
stands there's no time on my part and no money on theirs. I wantd to at least
get a homepage done for them
